In a world where echo chambers and polarized opinions can dominate the news landscape, Bias Buster News is a project that aims to promote informed and open-minded citizenship. 
This news website personalizes the news articles recommended to a reader based on their self-reported political affiliation.
Thus, it introduces you to news articles and topics that you might not typically explore, fostering a deeper understanding of political landscapes and diverse viewpoints. 
We believe that well-informed citizens are essential for a thriving democracy, and we're committed to helping you become one.
